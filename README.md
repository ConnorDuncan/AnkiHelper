Used to easily change cards from format:

Front: 'x'
Back: 'y (z)'


To the format:

Front: 'y'
Back: 'x (z)'


From Anki, export the card deck as a "Notes in Plain Text .txt" file with only the "Include HTML and Media References" and "Include Tags" checked. Rename the file to 'input.txt', put the 'input.txt' in the root of project folder 'AnkiHelper', run the program, then upload 'output.txt' for the new deck. Note: you may have to switch the front/backs of the cards afterwards in Anki.


This project is intended to be used for language studying, so someone is able to create one deck rather than two. For example, for Japanese, Kanji would be x, Hiragana would be y, and English meaning would be z.

Note: Doesn't work with media/audio. I don't use this feature and have no reason to work on it.
