Used to easily change cards from format:

Front: 'x'
Back: 'y (z)'


To the format:

Front: 'y'
Back: 'x (z)'


From Anki, export the card deck as a .txt file, put the 'input.txt' in the root of project folder 'AnkiHelper', run the program, then upload 'output.txt' for the new deck. Note: you may have to switch the front/backs of the cards.




This project is intended to be used for language studying, so someone is able to create one deck rather than two. For example, for Japanese, Kanji would be x, Hiragana would be y, and English meaning would be z.
